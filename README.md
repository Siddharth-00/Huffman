# Huffman
Rep to compress and decompress files using Huffman Encoding/Decoding. 

Code takes the file name of the file to compress and the file name of the compressed file and uses Huffman Encoding in Java, using a tree, to compress it. Also includes a decompressor so that you can get the original file back.
